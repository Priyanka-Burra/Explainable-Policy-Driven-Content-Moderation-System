# Explainable Policy-Driven Content Moderation System

## 1. Introduction
With the rapid growth of social media platforms, online forums, and digital communication channels, the volume of user-generated content has increased significantly. This surge has also led to the spread of harmful, abusive, misleading, and policy-violating content. Traditional content moderation systems often rely on black-box machine learning models, which lack transparency and user trust.

This project proposes an Explainable Policy-Driven Content Moderation System that combines machine learning techniques with clearly defined moderation policies to ensure transparent, fair, and accountable decision-making.

## 2. Problem Statement
Online platforms struggle to moderate large volumes of content while ensuring fairness, transparency, and compliance with platform policies. Existing automated moderation systems often fail to explain why content is flagged or removed, leading to user dissatisfaction and ethical concerns.

There is a need for a content moderation system that not only detects policy violations accurately but also provides understandable explanations for its decisions.

---

## 3. Objectives
- To design an automated content moderation system using machine learning techniques.
- To integrate policy-driven rules for consistent decision-making.
- To provide explainable outputs that justify moderation decisions.
- To improve transparency and trust in automated moderation systems.
- To reduce manual moderation effort while maintaining accuracy.

## 4. Scope of the Project
The system focuses on text-based content moderation such as comments, posts, or messages. It evaluates content against predefined policies and machine learning predictions. The project emphasizes explainability rather than only classification accuracy.

---

## 5. System Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture consisting of:
- Input content collection
- Text preprocessing
- Policy rule evaluation
- Machine learning-based classification
- Explainability module
- Final moderation decision

## 6. Methodology
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Feature extraction using NLP techniques
3. Content classification using machine learning models
4. Policy rule validation
5. Explainable AI techniques to justify decisions
6. Output generation with moderation status and explanation
